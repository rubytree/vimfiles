	* Fixed a bug in some of the regular expressions that incorrectly handled
	periods and dollar signs that were inside snippet definitions (tab-stops).
	This gets rid of an off by one error in higlighting and cursor placement.

	* Updated converter from TextMate bundles so now everything is stored in yaml
	rather than either ruby or some custom format.
	* No longer write out empty libraries (many don't have snippets defined).
	* Fixed off by one for multi-line snippets
	* Now using the TAB and SPACE settings of the current vim session so
	hopefully everyone will be happy with what they get.
